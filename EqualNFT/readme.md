Project Title: Staking DApp
Description
This is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to stake tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can stake their tokens, withdraw them, and claim rewards. This project utilizes Web3.js to connect to the blockchain, MetaMask for wallet integration, and React for the frontend. Our user-centric platform offers a dashboard similar to Notion to enhance productivity and manage all campaigns, providing an experience comparable to Galxe compass.
